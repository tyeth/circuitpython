"""Check the flash partition layout a board's devicetree actually resolved to.

Board overlays in ``boards/`` routinely rebuild the ``partitions`` node so the
board gets a CIRCUITPY filesystem. Rebuilding it is easy to get subtly wrong in
a way nothing reports: drop the ``ranges;`` the board DTS declared and
devicetree stops translating partition addresses into the SoC's address space,
so every partition resolves to a bare offset instead. The build still succeeds.
What changes is anything keyed off the address -- on RP2040,
``RP2_REQUIRES_SECOND_STAGE_BOOT`` matches the code partition against
0x10000100, so a partition left at 0x100 silently turns it off and the UF2 is
built for the wrong address with no second stage bootloader linked in.

A board that CircuitPython also builds from another port (``counterpart`` in its
``circuitpython.toml``) is additionally compared with that build: nvm and the
CIRCUITPY drive must sit exactly where ``ports/<port>`` puts them, or switching
firmware between the two builds loses the user's data. The expected placement
is derived from the counterpart's configuration files the same way its
``mpconfigport.h`` derives it.

This reads the ``edt.pickle`` a build already produced, so it costs no build
time -- point it at build directories after building, or run it with no
arguments to check every build directory in the port.
